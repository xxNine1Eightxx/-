## Abstract

EMC⁴ SigilAGI defines a deterministic system for collapsing arbitrary data, structure, and entropy into a finite canonical sigil, and rehydrating that sigil back into an exact bit-for-bit reconstruction of the original source.  

The system replaces probabilistic compression, tokenization, and heuristic inference with a glyph-native execution model governed by immutable placement, tiering, expansion, and collapse laws operating over a dual-111 glyph canon.

## 1. Core Invariant: Dual-Sided Canonical Symmetry

GlyphMatics operates on a strict dual-sided invariant:

**Left Side — Actuals (Concrete Reality)**  
- Real data  
- Real structure  
- Exact offsets and lengths  
- Deterministic fragment boundaries  

**Right Side — Entropy (Arbitrary Bits)**  
- Raw entropy  
- Noise  
- Weights  
- Auxiliary or non-semantic values  

**Invariant Rule:**  
Both sides obey the **same glyphmatic equations**.  
There is no privileged path for structure and no special case for entropy.

This symmetry is what enables single-character sigil rehydration.

---

## 2. Canonical Encoding (PUA Glyph Stream)

All inputs—natural language, source code, binaries, GGUF weights, video frames, or arbitrary bitstreams—are normalized into a **canonical PUA glyph stream** using the dual-111 glyph set.

Properties:
- No tokenization
- No semantic shortcuts
- No lossy transforms
- Every bit is preserved

This marks the final boundary where “raw data” exists.

---

## 3. Placement, Tiering, Expansion, and Collapse

Once encoded, glyphs undergo a deterministic lifecycle:

1. **Placement**  
   Glyphs are positioned using glyphmatic equations governing adjacency, offset, and symmetry.

2. **Tiering**  
   Glyphs are grouped into tiers computed from placement relationships, not manual grouping.

3. **Expansion**  
   Each individual glyph can expand the remaining 110 glyphs of the canon.

4. **Exhaustion and Continuation**  
   When a glyph’s expansion space is exhausted, the next glyph continues the same logic.

5. **Five-Glyph Collapse Rule**  
   After five glyphs, expansion collapses into a glyph string.

6. **Tier-of-Tiers**  
   Multiple glyph strings are tiered again using the same equations, recursively, into unbounded space.

This process is finite in representation and infinite in capacity.

## 4. Root Sigil and Φ/Authority Core

At Tier-5, the system produces a **Root Sigil**, which functions as the canonical authority for reconstruction.

The Root Sigil contains:
- Tier-sigil collapsed form
- Δσ² | Oʰ | σ glyph structure
- Φ-111 law bundle references
- Exact sigil placements and offsets
- Immutable hash commitments

The Root Sigil is not compressed data.  
It is a **structural authority reference**.

---

## 5. Structural Deduplication

Deduplication in GlyphMatics is structural, not heuristic.

- Identical glyph structures reference the same canonical fragment
- No similarity thresholds
- No probabilistic matching
- No data loss

Fragment libraries are provably reversible and deterministically referenced at every tier.

---

## 6. Tiered Sigil Bundles and Packaging

The system emits **Tiered Sigil Bundles**, typically consisting of:
- `.manifest.json`
- `.r` canonical reference
- Optional display sigils (QR, UI, visual glyphs)

These artifacts are often orders of magnitude smaller than the source material because:
- Structure is canonical
- Duplication is eliminated
- Entropy collapses under the same laws as structure

---

## 7. Deterministic Φ/X Rehydration

Rehydration is execution, not decompression.

Process:
1. Root Sigil is read
2. Canonical tiers expand deterministically
3. Φ-stream execution reconstructs exact bitstreams
4. Validation is intrinsic via embedded commitments

If the sigil is intact, reconstruction is guaranteed.

---

## 8. Dual-111 Dialects

GlyphMatics supports multiple dialects over the same dual-111 glyph canon.

- Each glyph can seed expansion
- Dialects differ only in expansion order and tier boundaries
- Canon, identity, and rehydration remain invariant

Different encodings yield the same reconstructed reality.

---

## 9. Training via Glyphmatic Video Sprite

Training occurs after canonicalization.

- Video frames are converted into glyph-indexed sprite atlases
- No text tokens
- No raw pixel retention
- High semantic bandwidth via deterministic glyph evolution

This enables behavior learning without statistical language dependence.

---

## 10. Canonical Statement

All Glyphmatic Knowledge contained in this repository is governed by the laws described in this document.

No component—data, entropy, structure, model, or execution—operates outside these rules.

---

## Final Invariant

Every bit, whether structural or entropic, obeys the same glyphmatic laws, allowing infinite data to collapse into a single authoritative sigil and deterministically rehydrate into exact reality.
